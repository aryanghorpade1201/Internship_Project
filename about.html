<h4> An "About Us" page in HTML provides information about a company, organization, or individual, <br>
typically including details like mission, history, team members, and contact information. <br>
It's a crucial element of many websites to build trust and engagement with visitors. <br>
Here's a breakdown of how to structure and create an "About Us" page using HTML:<br>
1. Basic Structure:<br>
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document as HTML5.<br>
<html>: Root element of the HTML page. <br>
<head>: Contains metadata about the page, such as title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts. <br>
<title>: Sets the title that appears in the browser tab. <br>
<meta>: Defines the character set and viewport for optimal display. <br>
<link>: Links to external stylesheets (CSS) for styling the page. <br>
<body>: Contains the visible content of the page, including headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements. <br>
2. Content Sections:<br>
<header>: Contains the page's heading, logo, and navigation. <br>
<main>: The main content area, often divided into sections like "Mission," "History," "Our Team," and "Contact Us". <br>
<h1>: Main heading of the page, usually "About Us". <br>
<h2>: Subheadings for different sections (e.g., "Our Mission", "Our History"). <br>
<p>: Paragraphs for text content. <br>
<img>: Used to display images, such as team photos or company logos. <br>
<ul> and <li>: Used to create lists, like bullet points for key points. <br>
<address>: Used for contact information, including address, phone number, and email. <br>
<a href>: Links to other pages or external websites. </h4><br>
